# Project Plan
## Cooperation Plan
### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
- Robert: all around experience at 301 level in HTML, CSS, JS
- Alan: some JS experience from earlier this year
- Timothee: real rookie
- Daniel: tactical Army SatComm (7 years), 1 year IT infrastructure, some Python, Java

### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?  
Generally, we'll tap the strengths of each member, but we do not want to silo anybody by any particular skill or lack of skill.

### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?  
We all want experience working in a team of equals; we also would like to develop ourselves on all facets of the fullstack spectrum, CSS, HTML, JS.

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?  
We will adapt as we go, but we can create a mirroring project, where even if a member gets a lopsided amount of CSS, e.g. we'll figure out a way to get involved on the JS side.

## Conflict Plan
- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?  
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?  
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?  
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

The above questions all address conflicts in the group, so we're wrapping it into a single answer:
For any potential conflicts, we plan to work things out on a consensual basis, but assuming a real conflict arises, we would plan to go through a pros and cons scrum session and weight it from there.  We'll still strive to reach consensus.

## Communication Plan
### What hours will you be available to communicate?
Target same hours as normal CF class hours: 9:00 - 17:00 PST.

### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Slack, Remo

### How often will you take breaks?
10 minutes per hour.

### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
Get together and sort out the issue.

- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
24/7 is fine with everbody, and via slack as first level communications.

- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

We're wrapping the last 2 questions together: we'll simply adapt and deal with it on an ad hoc basis; from initial group interaction, there do not appear to be any issues with openness and feedback.

## Work Plan
### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
Github Project Board.  We already played with it and like it.
### What project management tool will be used?
Same as above.
We are considering working with Mob programming tools.

## Git Process
### What components of your project will live on GitHub?
Everything.

### How will you share the repository with your teammates?
We already did that; Robert established and made us all owners.

### What is your Git flow?
We intend to use Mob to handle that flow.

### Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
#### How many people must review a PR?
2
#### Who merges PRs?
Initial idea is to assign Daniel to this.
#### How often will you merge?
At least once per day, or as often as needed, e.g. when a new feature is complete.

### How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
Either via remo or slack.
